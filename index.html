                <h1> Duck Debugging</h1>
                <p>Rubber duck debugging is a technique commonly used by programmers to solve problems by explaining the issue to an inanimate object, such as a rubber duck.The idea behind this technique is that by describing the problem step by step, the programmer gains a deeper understanding of the issue and often discovers the solution in the process. In recent years, the concept of rubber duck debugging has gained popularity among programmers. The idea is to use a rubber duck (or any other inanimate object) as a "listener" to explain code and solve problems. </p>

                    <p>Many years ago, a programmer named Andy was working on a complex software problem. He was struggling to find the cause of the issue despite spending hours debugging the code. Feeling frustrated and stuck, Andy decided to take a break and clear his mind.

                      At that time, Andy had a rubber duck on his desk as a decoration. As he was looking at the duck, he had an idea. He picked up the rubber duck and started explaining the problem to it, line by line, just to vocalize his thoughts. To his surprise, as he went through the code and described each step to the duck, he suddenly realized the mistake he had made.</p>
